/**
 * The first-load level picker's data — words per level and a few sample words per
 * level — shipped with the bundle instead of fetched.
 *
 * The picker used to ask the server for a whole feed page just to read the metadata
 * riding on it, so the very first screen waited on a query before its ladder could
 * fill. Catalogs only change with a deploy, so the figures are fixed per build: they
 * are compiled into data/level-ladder.json by the level-ladder test (`vitest -u`),
 * which also fails whenever a catalog changes without the snapshot being refreshed.
 *
 * Exports: LevelLadder, buildLevelLadder, buildLevelLadders, levelLadderFor
 * Depends on: ../data/level-ladder.json, ./paging, ./target-language
