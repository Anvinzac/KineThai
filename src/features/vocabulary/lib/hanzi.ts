/**
 * CJK (Han) spelling-coda helpers: script detection and stroke-draw timing.
 *
 * This module is deliberately PURE and imports no stroke data, so the card can branch
 * on it without pulling Hanzi Writer or the vendored stroke JSON into the English feed
 * chunk (see the vocabulary bundle-boundary rule). The heavy data lives beside the
 * lazily-imported HanziStrokeSpelling component instead.
 *
 * Timing model: the coda occupies a FIXED draw budget derived from the character count
 * alone (pure), then settle + hold. The component turns that budget into a per-stroke
 * speed using the real stroke count it reads from the bundled data, so a dense character
 * draws its many strokes faster and a simple one slower, while the card's playback timer
 * only ever needs the character count. This keeps timing owned by the playback hook.
 *
 * Exports: isHanAnswer, getHanCharCount, getStrokeDrawBudgetSeconds, getStrokeSpellingDurationMs,
 *   solveStrokeTiming,
 *   STROKE_DRAW_BASE_SECONDS, STROKE_DRAW_PER_CHAR_SECONDS, STROKE_DRAW_MAX_SECONDS,
 *   STROKE_SETTLE_SECONDS, STROKE_MIN_MS, STROKE_MAX_MS
 * Depends on: ./spelling (hold + reduced-motion constants only)
