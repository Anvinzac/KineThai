/**
 * Wide-card geometry, mirrored from vocabulary.css so the fit pipeline sizes and places
 * text against the room the stylesheet actually gives it.
 *
 * On a card wider than it is tall the stylesheet derives every band from the same few
 * numbers: the toolbar head above, the bottom chrome stack below (fixed in portrait,
 * 15% of the shell height on a short viewport), and a clearance between the two. The
 * answer word's band and the clue pages' band are both STRETCHED by the fit solver's
 * own reserved margins (72px above, 132px below), so that the area the solver will
 * place text in lands exactly on the free height. Two things in JS have to agree with
 * that geometry and used to restate it as guesses:
 *   - where the answer word sits in its band (`revealY`, a percentage of the band); the
 *     margins are asymmetric, so the middle of the usable area is NOT 50% of the band;
 *   - how much height a clue page is budgeted (`getVocabularyTextHeightBudget`).
 * Both are derived here instead. `npm run check:landscape` reads the stylesheet and
 * fails if any number below stops matching it.
 *
 * Not mirrored: `env(safe-area-inset-bottom)`. In the short tier it is absorbed by the
 * gap (the chrome's top edge stays on the band); only the tall-landscape portrait stack
 * grows by it, where the fit solver's own shrink covers the few pixels of difference.
 *
 * Exports: SHORT_VIEWPORT_MAX_H, COMPACT_VIEWPORT_MAX_H, LANDSCAPE_GEOMETRY,

 *          getClueBandStretch, getWideRevealY
 * Depends on: post-player playback-timing (the fit solver's safe insets)
