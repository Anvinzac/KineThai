/**
 * The Chay Lá app family as a rounded panel that unfolds from the pill in
 * front of the page title and notches around it.
 *
 * A grid rather than the earlier ring: an arc only seats four or five tiles
 * before the labels collide, and the family is meant to reach ten.
 *
 * App tiles are plain anchors — sibling subdomains are separate deployments, so
 * they are full navigations. The store tile is a router Link, being our own page.
 *
 * Exports: EcosystemMenu, ECOSYSTEM_EXIT_MS
 * Depends on: router Link, ecosystem app data, usePresence, ecosystem.css
